# Bird-Image-Classification
This project implements a deep learning-based classification model for identifying different species of birds using MATLAB's Deep Network Designer. The model is trained on a dataset of bird images and utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
