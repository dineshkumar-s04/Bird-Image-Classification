# 🦜 Bird-Image-Classification
This project implements a deep learning-based classification model for identifying different species of birds using MATLAB's Deep Network Designer. The model is trained on a dataset of bird images and utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.


# ✨ Features

🖥️ Uses MATLAB's Deep Network Designer for model creation and training.

🔄 Implements transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet).

📸 Supports custom dataset loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.

📊 Provides performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrices, and loss curves.

🎛️ GUI-based approach, making it easy to modify and fine-tune hyperparameters.

# 📂 Dataset
